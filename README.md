#Movie Finder

I have made this project using Node js, Express, ejs and used 2 API's to get the data of the movies which are searched.
When you search movie you get the image of the movie or series you get the timeline of the movie, release year of the movie, rank, imdb ratings, imdb votes and descrition of the movie
